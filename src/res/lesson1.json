  "description": "Look at what the children are doing in the picture. Is it easy? \n\nEvery person, even if they are young, has something to help others. Just like a child like you, you can also do a lot for some people not only with your siblings, friends, or relatives, but also with people who are in dire need of help in the street, in the market, or in front of the church. Although we have problems, we can still help other people. It is important to have a strong will. This means not giving up problems despite the difficulties experienced. There are even times when personal needs must be sacrificed for the sake of others. Perhaps, young people like you just need the right guidance from the elders. With the right guidance, no matter how difficult the task is, anyone can handle it.",
  "objectives": "In this lesson, you will... \n\n •   present the decision that is good for the majority, \\n\n •    will be able to use valid information, and \n\n •   will prove that fortitude helps work that improves the person.",
  "mainthought": "Fortitude is manifested in work that makes you feel better no matter how difficult it is."
